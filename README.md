# mirandat3

The project has been forked from https://github.com/krig/mirandat.py

The original project is able to export history from Miranda IM dat-files.

My goal is to make the following changes to the project:
* port it to Python3 :heavy_check_mark:
* make sure it works with national encodings
* make the output slightly more readable
* add HTML export.
