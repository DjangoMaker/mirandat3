# mirandat.py

I moved away from using windows to exclusively using Linux and Mac OS quite a long time ago. I had some old ICQ logs from when I was using Miranda IM and to be able to read them without having to install Miranda via wine or something like that, I wrote a little python script which takes a Miranda .dat database and extracts all the messages from it.

I don't guarantee that it will work for any version of Miranda, but it worked for me. It should be fairly easy to modify so that it reads other versions as well.
